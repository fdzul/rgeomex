**rgeomex is a package developed in the department of prevention and
control of diseases transmitted by vector of the
[CENAPRECE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/cenaprece) with collaboration of
the
[INDRE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/acciones-y-programas/instituto-de-diagnostico-y-referencia-epidemiologicos-mision-vision-y-politica-de-calidad-181639?state=published)**

## **overview**

**rgeomex** is a package to provide spatial dataset (areal data)
available and published homepage of
[INE](https://pautas.ine.mx/transparencia/mapas/) and
[INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/mg). These spatial dataset are
useful for visualization and spatial analysis of diseases. The secondary
objective of the package is to provide spatial bases for the calculation
of dengue hotspots and their vectors. The package has six spatial
datasets.

- **`blocks_ine20_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of
  blocks from Mexico (INE 2020).
- **`localities_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of
  localities from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
- **`AGEB_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEBs
  from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
- **`AGEE_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEE
  from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
- **`AGEM_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEM
  from Mexico (INEGI 2019).

## Inspiration

The package was inspired by the need to contribute toward making
decisions in the dengue prevention and control program, specifically
through the identification of dengue vector hotspots and use the
entomological information generated by the program.
