**rgeomex** is a package developed in the [CENAPRECE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/cenaprece) dengue prevention and control program in collaboration with [INDRE](https://www.gob.mx/salud/acciones-y-programas/instituto-de-diagnostico-y-referencia-epidemiologicos-mision-vision-y-politica-de-calidad-181639?state=published), and the states of Veracruz and Yucatan.


## **overview**

**rgeomex**. Geographic data and geographical datasets from the [INEGI](https://www.inegi.org.mx/temas/mg) and [INE](https://pautas.ine.mx/transparencia/mapas/) are available in the R package **rgeomex**. Geographical data at various resolutions (states, municipalities, localities, agebs, blocks, sectors, and neighborhoods) constitute  the majority of the package's content.

**rgeomex** constitutes a transversal package of the **ETVerse** and **IVAverse** initiatives. **rgeomex**, together with  denepikit, denhotspots, deneggs, and dencontrol packages, constitute a universe of packages that make up the dengueverse of the dengue prevention and control program in Mexico.

The package has six spatial datasets.

  - **`blocks_ine20_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of blocks from Mexico (INE 2020).
  - **`loc_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of localities from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
  - **`AGEB_inegi_2019_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEBs (Area Geostadística Basica) from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
  - **`AGEE_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEE (Area Geostadística Estatal) from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
  - **`AGEM_inegi19_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data of AGEM (Area Geostadística Municipal) from Mexico (INEGI 2019).
  - **`sectores_ine20_mx`** spatial dataset containing polygon data sectores INE from Mexico.

This package is currently available only in R, and we hope that it will soon become available in Python.
